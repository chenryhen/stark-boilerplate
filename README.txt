	STARKERS

	Created by Viewport Industries, Ltd.

	Starkers is a bare-bones WordPress theme 
	created to act as a starting point for the 
	theme designer. Free of all style, 
	presentational elements, and non-semantic 
	markup, Starkers is the perfect ‘blank slate’ 
	for all your WordPress projects.

	Best of all: it’s free and fully GPL-licensed, 
	so you can use it for whatever you like — even 
	commercial work.

	Up until now, Starkers has merely been a 
	stripped-back version of the default theme 
	that ships with WordPress, and as a result has 
	never been quite as ‘naked’ as it could be. 
	Now we’ve brought it under the Viewport 
	Industries banner and have rebuilt it from the 
	ground up. Literally. Not one line of code is 
	the same.
